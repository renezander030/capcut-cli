**An independent CLI for CapCut / JianYing that any LLM agent can drive — zero dependencies, no server, both namespaces in one binary.**

JSON in, JSON out: every command reads and writes the local draft store directly, with no MCP server or HTTP daemon. On newer CapCut versions it detects and synchronizes every readable timeline target instead of assuming `draft_content.json` is the only source of truth. That gives any model (Claude, DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi) a deterministic boundary for inspection, building, subtitles, captions, translation, and long-form cuts.

**Use it three ways:**

- **CLI** — `npm install -g capcut-cli`, then `capcut <command> <project>`
- **Library** — `import { loadDraft, lintDraft, saveDraft } from "capcut-cli"` (typed, zero-dep)
- **Queue runner** — `capcut serve` reads JSONL jobs from stdin, for [n8n / Make / Coze](./examples/serve-automation.md)

> **New in v0.15.0:** a write-time version guard that refuses beyond-evidence or known-broken drafts unless `--force-write`, in-place segment deletion with orphaned-material cleanup (`remove`), raw store resource ids, working `--intensity`, whole-timeline `--full`, and experimental per-segment `--bind` on `add-filter`/`add-effect`, and `lint` unknown-slug coverage extended to transitions, masks, sound effects, bubbles, and fonts. Full details in the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

> **New in v0.14.0:** duplicate a segment onto an overlay track above its source (`duplicate`), repair missing draft registration on existing drafts (`register`), read + edit the source-material crop (`crop --ratio | --rect`), per-word keyword emphasis and per-cue colour cycling for captions (`--highlight-words`, `--keyword-size`, `--color-cycle` on `caption`/`import-srt`), and UTF-8 BOM tolerance on every file the CLI reads. Full details in the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Install

**Prerequisites:** Node ≥ 18 (built-ins only — no native modules). Optional tools unlock specific commands: Whisper for `caption`, FFmpeg for `render`, ffprobe for automatic media metadata, and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for `translate`.

```bash
npm install -g capcut-cli      # or: npx capcut-cli <command>
```

Build from source instead: `git clone https://github.com/renezander030/capcut-cli && cd capcut-cli && npm install && npm run build` (then `npm link` to expose `capcut`).

## Quickstart

```bash
capcut doctor                                  # verify Node, FFmpeg, whisper, draft dirs
capcut quickstart my-first --video clip.mp4    # create + add input + lint, prints the "open in CapCut" step
capcut info ./my-first/                         # inspect the draft (add -H for a table)
```

Then open the project in CapCut to review and render. Every short-video platform forbids automated upload, so the publish click stays human.

## Commands

JSON by default (pipe to `jq`); add `-H` for a human-readable table. Pass `--jianying` to use the JianYing enum namespace. Run `capcut <command> --help` for full flags.

| Group | Commands |
|-------|----------|
| **Inspect** | `info` · `tracks` · `materials` · `version` · `lint` |
| **Browse / drill in** | `segments` · `texts` · `segment` · `material` |
| **Create** | `init` · `quickstart` · `compile` (build a draft from a JSON spec) |
| **Preview** | `render` (low-res ffmpeg proxy — not CapCut's final render) |
| **Add** | `add-video` · `add-audio` · `add-text` (Wikimedia URLs supported, license-checked) |
| **Edit / animate** | trim · speed · volume · transitions · masks · text/image animations · easing curves |
| **Templates** | apply and extract reusable layouts · `make-preset` (portable text-style presets) |
| **Subtitles & i18n** | `caption` · `import-srt` · `export-srt` (line/word SRT + VTT) · `translate` (multi-language draft clone) |
| **Effects** | `sfx` · `chroma` (chroma key) |
| **Long-form → short** | `cut` · `detect-scenes` (ffmpeg scene-cut detection) |
| **Automation** | `serve` (stateless JSONL runner) · `migrate` · `doctor` · `sync-timelines` (8.7 mirror repair) |

## How it works

CapCut/JianYing store each project as local JSON. capcut-cli loads that store, validates against a version-aware schema, applies your edit, and writes it back atomically (with a `.bak`). No project files are uploaded anywhere; nothing runs as a service. See [docs/version-support.md](./docs/version-support.md) for the CapCut/JianYing versions and schema flags it understands.
